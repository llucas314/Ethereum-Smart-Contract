# Ethereum Smart Contract

This project is a simple implementation of an ERC-721 (NFT) smart contract using Solidity. It creates a non-fungible token (NFT) called **hortest-home** with the symbol **OHOSTETEO-**. It also includes a custom `message()` function to display a static call-to-action string.

## Features

- Built on the ERC-721 standard  
- Immutable public message for collectors or community engagement  
- Foundation for expanding into more complex NFT logic (metadata, minting, etc.)
